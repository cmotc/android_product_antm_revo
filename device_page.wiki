{{Remove_only_when_finished|This page needs to be properly filled according to the [[New_Device_howto |New Device Howto]] and the [[New_Device_page|New Device Page guide]].}}

{{Remove|If a device is special, then feel free to provide a terse description of what makes this device so special. But terse, no novels, no marketing blurb.}}

= Identification =

On the back of the device, the following is printed:
		ANTM LOGO
		ANTM USA INC.
		MODEL:AN708
		FCC ID: 2ACPN-M-752A
<pre>ANTM REVO 708
AN708</pre>

The PCB has no immediately visible silkscreening, it appears to be concealed
behind a ribbon cable which is proving difficult to remove. Regardless, the
build number, model number, and device label are readily apparent.

In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find:
* Model Number: ''AN708''
* Build Number: ''astar_d87-eng 4.4.2 KVT49L 20150128 test-keys''

= Sunxi support =

== Current status ==

There is no support for this device in sunxi yet.

== Manual build ==

You can build things for yourself by following our [[Manual_build_howto | Manual build howto]] and by choosing from the configurations available below.

=== U-Boot ===

==== Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot ====

Use the [https://github.com/linux-sunxi/u-boot-sunxi/blob/mirror/next/configs/q8_a33_tablet_1024x600_defconfig ''q8_a33_tablet_1024x600_defconfig''] build target.

==== Mainline U-Boot ====

Use the [https://github.com/linux-sunxi/u-boot-sunxi/blob/mirror/next/configs/q8_a33_tablet_1024x600_defconfig ''q8_a33_tablet_1024x600_defconfig''] build target.

=== Linux Kernel ===

==== Sunxi/Legacy Kernel ====

This device is strikingly similar to the A-Star KV49L. We'll need to fork this
Fex file probably. [https://github.com/linux-sunxi/sunxi-boards/blob/master/sys_config/a33/a-star_kv49l.fex ''a-star_kv49l.fex''] file.

==== Mainline kernel ====

Use the ''{{Edit|FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb}}'' device-tree binary.

= Tips, Tricks, Caveats =

{{Remove|Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.}}

== FEL mode ==

Holding the volume up button before powering on the tablet boots the tablet into
recovery move. If that doesn't work, it's easiest to use adb. Just type adb
reboot recovery.

== Interior Form Factor ==

This device is extensively glued and taped internally, with lots of screws. You
actually have to take the whole screen out to get it fully disassembled, which
is why it's going to take a minute for me to get good pictures of the insides.

= Adding a serial port ('''voids warranty''') =

This section explains how to attach a serial port to the device. Make sure it refers to our [[UART|UART howto]]. For a development board, you can just mention how to find the header with the pins and include a picture, and you can remove the warranty voiding warning.

Need to get better pictures and help.

== Device disassembly ==

This device is a common plastic tablet following the [[Format_Q8]] tablet
format. To disassemble it, locate the elliptical impression near the 3.5mm jack
and place your plastic tool into the seam behind the screen. Twist gently to
unsnap the first latch, and move your plastic tool toward the closest corner.
Work your way all around the edge, twisting when necessary to unsnap latches as
they are encountered.

== Locating the UART ==

Need to get better pictures and help.
