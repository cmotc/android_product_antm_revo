{{Remove_only_when_finished|This page needs to be properly filled according to the [[New_Device_howto |New Device Howto]] and the [[New_Device_page|New Device Page guide]].}}

{{Remove|If a device is special, then feel free to provide a terse description of what makes this device so special. But terse, no novels, no marketing blurb.}}

= Identification =

On the back of the device, the following is printed:
		ANTM LOGO
		ANTM USA INC.
		MODEL:AN708
		FCC ID: 2ACPN-M-752A
<pre>ANTM REVO 708
AN708</pre>

The PCB has no immediately visible silkscreening, it appears to be concealed
behind a ribbon cable which is proving difficult to remove. Regardless, the
build number, model number, and device label are readily apparent.

In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find:
* Model Number: ''AN708''
* Build Number: ''astar_d87-eng 4.4.2 KVT49L 20150128 test-keys''

= Sunxi support =

== Current status ==

There is no support for this device in sunxi yet.

== Images ==

{{Remove|Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific sunxi ROM images here. E.g. a livesuit image or some other linux image which uses linux-sunxi code. Do not put non-sunxi images here, they should live under [[#See_also|See also]]. If no sunxi based images are available, this section can be removed.}}

== HW-Pack ==

{{Remove|Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE sunxi HW-pack specifics here. When empty, this section can be removed.}}

== BSP ==

{{Remove|Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE sunxi BSP specifics here. When empty, this section can be removed.}}

== Manual build ==

You can build things for yourself by following our [[Manual_build_howto | Manual build howto]] and by choosing from the configurations available below.

=== U-Boot ===

==== Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot ====

Use the ''{{Edit|MANUFACTURER_DEVICE}}'' build target.

==== Mainline U-Boot ====

Use the ''{{Edit|MANUFACTURER_DEVICE}}'' build target.

=== Linux Kernel ===

==== Sunxi/Legacy Kernel ====

This device is strikingly similar to the A-Star KV49L. We'll need to fork this
Fex file probably. [https://github.com/linux-sunxi/sunxi-boards/blob/master/sys_config/a33/a-star_kv49l.fex | ''a-star_kv49l.fex''] file.

==== Mainline kernel ====

Use the ''{{Edit|FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb}}'' device-tree binary.

= Tips, Tricks, Caveats =

{{Remove|Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.}}

== FEL mode ==

The {{Edit|something}} button triggers [[FEL | FEL mode]].

== {{Edit|Device specific topic}} ==

{{Remove|If there are no further device specific topics to add, remove these sections.}}

== {{Edit|...}} ==

= Adding a serial port ('''voids warranty''') =

[[File:device_uart.jpg|thumb|240px|{{Remove|DEVICE}} UART pads]]

{{Remove|This section explains how to attach a serial port to the device. Make sure it refers to our [[UART|UART howto]]. For a development board, you can just mention how to find the header with the pins and include a picture, and you can remove the warranty voiding warning.}}

== Device disassembly ==

{{Remove|If necessary, provide a short description of how to open the device. Perhaps explain how the pins can be most easily popped. If pins do need to be popped, mention the [[Plastic_tool|Plastic tool howto]].}}

== Locating the UART ==

{{Remove|Describe how to find the RX,TX,GND signals here, and mention the [[UART|UART howto]].}}

= Pictures =

{{Remove|Take some pictures of your device, [[Special:Upload | upload them]], and add them here. DO NOT UPLOAD PICTURES WHICH YOU PLUCKED OFF THE INTERNET.}}
